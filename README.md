# Android PopupWindow MVP

This is a very simple, basic concept application that shows how to use the PopupWindow MVP implementation.

the real benefit here is that you can use the template to save your time and make the code simple and readabel.

you just need to extend the BasePopup class if you see the exapmle it will help you to understand how to do it,
but anyway the android studio will help you to extend the class and all what they need step by step ,
use android studio shortcuts to make it faster (ALT+ENTER) so easy.


Libraries in use:
* ButterKnife
